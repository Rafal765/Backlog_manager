# Backlog manager

A simple app to create one or more backlogs and fill them with entries organized by groups (default is for anime,
books, games and movies/tv series). Entries on the backlog can be further organized by their status 
(planned, ongoing, done) and in order you prefer (e.g. the most important on top of the list).
